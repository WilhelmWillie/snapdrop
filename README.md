# SnapDrop

This is the source code for SnapDrop, a project spun up during SBHacks III 2017. 

SnapDrop is a community and platform for photo enthusiasts to find cool locations for photo shoots. Using SnapDrop is simple: Browse the map and search for snap spots posted by the SnapDrop community. Get inspired by photographers in the area, find great spots to take photos, and share your own. To share photos with the community, double click the map or press the plus in the top right corner, upload your photo, set the correct location, and add a little writeup + details. The result is a collaborative open community and platform for photography enthusiasts, both amateur and professional.
